   <h1>Roleplaying Game by SoraMafuUraSaka in english, this took forever</h1>

<h2> Yearning to be a hero someday (Yearning~)
Though knowing it's impossible to succeed,
i still hop in. The end of the story. </h2>

<h2> Gathering as a group of four (Group of four~) </h2>

<h2> See, doing anything and everything, the monk behind that folding screen
from amywheres to anything always so good at leaving all the tasks to the others \chi-n/ </h2>

<h2> Collecting the herb aconite (Aconite~) getting on goal with a full approach-run. The grass wont even grow </h2>

<h2> That guy, this guy everyone's useless (Useless~) Whose fault is it? it's his fault. When night falls, we're still finding someone to blame it on </h2>

<h2> Special move to win from behind in one turn? None. Escape item to use when you're lost in the depths of a dungeon? None. Game guide? Dumped into the trashcan ages ago. Eh!? Completely stuck two players already died. Saved data is also gone too.</h2>

<h2> In forced-scroll parts, spending all the ability points on AGI. Don't have a healer, 4 no-hopers Eggplants and tomatoes, all lined up together. Can't even choose a useful character. This is a bug right?! </h2>

<h2> Still no way no way! I'll go headfirst! Starting from the first village not progressing at all \Yes Yes!/ </h2>

<h2> 1 times 4 is even less than 0. One year has already passed! That's enough playing guys---!!! For example in a gacha, we would have about 2 stars. Though its not an SSR \Yes Yes!/ </h2>

<h2> We still want to be ourselves. Staying up late with you, playing RPG </h2>

<h2> So everyone, it's teamwork OK? Understood. Ugh who's the one pulling the team behind? It's Soraru-san's who's progressing too fast! I'm just opening the paths so everyone can play more easily. That's just your excuse, right? To us, it's giving us troubles  </h2>

<h2> Right? Sakata? UWAAAAA!!! I'm gonna be killed by MafuMafuuuuu!!! Hyahahahaha! Everyone dieeee! Aah!! Me too? Mafumafu i definetly wont forgive you! </h2>

<h2> Please someone help meeeeee! Where has all the teamwork gone guys? </h2>

<h2> Surprises up to 5,6 tera, always playing with no back-ups. Run Toad, it's juicy-easy, no problem! </h2>

<h2> Starting from 2 am, playing for 6 hours. This doesn't seem to be ending. I'm tired</h2>

<h2> Still no way no way! The winner's got the say! Opportunism will never stop \Yes Yes!/ </h2>

<h2> Being a flip-flopper will only cost your life. I wont't allow that to happen! </h2>

<h2> Until the very last moment, still forgetting to save. Lets not mention how miserable it felt \Yes Yes!/ </h2>

<h2> Endlessly, restlessly, receiving punishments. Go back to the very beginning RPG! </h2>

<h2> The legendary sword that casts all evil away? None. None. None none none none </h2>

<h2> The magical shield that protects that girl from danger? None. None. None none none None </h2>

<h2> The ship that soars in the great skies? None. None. None none none None </h2>

<h2> The will to go on a journey to save the world? None. None. None none none None </h2>

<h2> Be covered by darkness! Ball Pen! </h2>

<h2> Get roasted! Black forest bread </h2>

<h2> Freeze as much as possible! Refrigerator! </h2>

<h2> Yes, this is my best final essence! Infinity Impact! </h2>

<h2> Huh? Huhhh? Huhhhhhh? You guys!!! </h2>

<h2> At the end of the world, on the other side. </h2>

<h2> If we defeat the Demon King when the end roll plays, where will our tomorrows be? </h2>

<h2> Still no way no way! I'll go headfirst! Starting from the first village not progressing at all \Yes yes!/ </h2>

<h2> 1 times 4 is even less than 0! 100 years have already passed! </h2>

<h2> Uwooooooooooo! That might not be a bad thing afterall as it can help kill our time \Yes yes! </h2>

<h2> I want to spend my whole life venturing, staying up late with you playing RPG </h2>

<h2> (under 4k characters of code yay!) </h2>
